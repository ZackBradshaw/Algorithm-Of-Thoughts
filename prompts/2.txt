To accomplish the task, we need to decompose it into explicit subtasks using a search process. The problem set we will be working with is '8 6 4 4'. Here is a step-by-step guide to solving this problem:

First operations:

Start the search process by choosing the first operation to explore.
Highlight this operation as '1'.
Subtask 1:

Decompose the task by breaking it down into subtasks.
Highlight this subtask as '2'.
Subtask 2:

Decompose subtask 1 further into atomic subtasks.
Highlight this subtask as '3'.
Atomic subtask 1:

Analyze the first atomic subtask.
Provide a solution for this atomic subtask.
Atomic subtask 2:

Analyze the second atomic subtask.
Provide a solution for this atomic subtask.
Atomic subtask 3:

Analyze the third atomic subtask.
Provide a solution for this atomic subtask.
Atomic subtask 4:

Analyze the fourth atomic subtask.
Provide a solution for this atomic subtask.
Subtask 3:

Combine the solutions of the atomic subtasks to solve subtask 2.
Highlight this subtask as '4'.
Subtask 4:

Analyze the fourth subtask.
Provide a solution for this subtask.
Subtask 5:

Analyze the fifth subtask.
Provide a solution for this subtask.
Subtask 6:

Analyze the sixth subtask.
Provide a solution for this subtask.
Subtask 7:

Analyze the seventh subtask.
Provide a solution for this subtask.
Subtask 8:

Analyze the eighth subtask.
Provide a solution for this subtask.
End result: After solving all the subtasks, consolidate the solutions to obtain the definitive end result.

Summary: To summarize, we decomposed the initial task into explicit subtasks using a search process with markers '1' to '3'. We then analyzed and provided solutions for each subtask atomically. Finally, we combined the subtask solutions to obtain the definitive end result.
